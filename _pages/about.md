I hold an MSc Social Research Methods from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and a BSc (Hons) Economics from the University of Nottingham. 

Currently, I work as an Economics Researcher at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia. My current research focus is on nation-building in plural societies through education. 

You can read more about my work in the [publications](https://hansonchongzz.github.io/publications) section of this website. 

My interests are in social network analysis and causal inference. 

Beyond my academic work, I founded a student non-profit called [The EMPOWER Initiative](https://www.instagram.com/m_pwr_) to tackle the lack of college readiness in Malaysia.
