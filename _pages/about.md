👋 I hold an MSc Social Research Methods from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and a BSc (Hons) Economics from the University of Nottingham. 

💼 Currently, I work as an Economics Researcher at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia. My current research focus is on the labour impacts of generative AI in Malaysia. I will be expanding this research to the East Asia and Pacific region.

📖 You can read more about my work in the [publications](https://hansonchongzz.github.io/publications) section of this website. 

❤️ My interests are in social network analysis and causal inference. I care about public policies that enhance social mobility, or how people can build a life they want through the work of their hands. 

🏠 Beyond my academic work, I founded a student non-profit called [The EMPOWER Initiative](https://www.instagram.com/m_pwr_) to tackle the lack of college readiness in Malaysia.
