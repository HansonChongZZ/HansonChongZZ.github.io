permalink: /publication/masters-thesis
excerpt: '> Ethnic homophily in plural societies leads to the perpetuation of social inequalities and unresolved ethnic tensions. The Contact Hypothesis posits that intergroup contact can reduce prejudice and improve ethnic relations. This paper examines the associations between intergroup contact in national schools, the lack thereof in ethnic-exclusive education institutions, and the extent of homophily in the friendship networks of Malaysian university students. Malaysia offers a unique context to study ethnic relations in a plural society due to ethnic segregation in education pathways. Utilising moderation analysis of the ethnic homophily terms in an egocentric exponential random graph model (ERGM), I find evidence that attending national secondary schools is associated with lower levels of ethnic homophily in university friendship network. I find no evidence to support the claim that attending ethnic- exclusive education institutions amplify ethnic homophily. These findings suggest that friendship formation at the university is affected by experiences in both primary and secondary school, implying that contact effects are enduring.'
